I don't remember if I had tried doing assembly or generated it using some UNIX util but it is there at [Hello_World.s](Mine_Old/hello_world.s)

Most of the work here is when I was learning programming for the first time so there is not error prevention, many stupid programs, some fun and stupid files etc

Below is the list of programs which are known to be non-working

-   [Palindrome](Mine_Old/palindrome.c)
-   [Calculate Power of](Mine_Old/calc_power.c)

> [!NOTE]
> Files in [dir](Akshat_Sir) were hand written notes provided by my first CS teacher Akshat Sir
> 
> Since I was copying them from notes into a [text](Akshat_Sir/txt-format/) file later copied over to C files, many of those programs are buggy or outright wrong
>
> In future I may try and fix them
